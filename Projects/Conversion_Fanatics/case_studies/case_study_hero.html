                        <p>A client who sells premium, high-priced furniture is not getting a 
                            large sale volume despite having a decent amount of qualified traffic. 
                            They are having the most success with lower-priced items, but cannot lower 
                            prices in order to make sales due to production and delivery costs. 
                            They would like to learn more about user motivations and increase the 
                            sales on items in the higher price&nbsp;range.

                        <p>The initial examination of the site did not show many functional issues with the 
                            funnel. The site was very clean, had clear calls to action, and a straight-forward 
                            purchase-process and pricing structure. We had no "emergency" fixes such as broken 
                            links or loading errors. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With that in mind, we began our user journey where we tried to discover points of friction 
                            from the perspective of a user. This meant gathering some initial data:

                    <h3>Heatmaps, Recordings, Client-call</h3>
                    <p>
                        - Heatmaps revealed that users are not scrolling much on the homepage
                         or product pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - About half the homepage visitors do not scroll below the full-screen hero and instead
                         navigate immediately to the collections page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - The products below the hero that lead directly to product pages are getting decent
                         clicks, but only by users who scroll.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Google Analytics, A/A test results</h3>  
                    <p>
                        - GA showed us that despite product pages receiving the most qualified, paid traffic, 
                        the homepage was still the highest-converting landing page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - The most popular product was a $100 shelf that was receiving little direct or paid traffic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Ads that were bringing users to the site were focused on the desk with a price in the 
                        $1000 to $1500 range, and directed to the desk's product page.
