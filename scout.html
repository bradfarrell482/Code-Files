                        <p>When I started at Scout in 2016, they had just finished their new website and brought me on to help
                            unify their brand. With offices in Boston and Chicago and sales associates all over the country,
                            they needed someone to help shift their image from a scrappy startup to that of a high-tech,
                            data-driven software company.</p>

                        <p>As a member of the marketing team, my primary duty was to help establish and enforce the company
                            brand guidelines. As the only full-time designer at Scout, I generated work used in online and
                            offline marketing, trade shows, presentations, and videos. With guidance from the VP of Marketing
                            and Scout’s President, I was part of the approval chain for all outward-facing marketing materials.</p>

                    <p>Scout’s marketing strategy branches across multiple forms of media, but a great deal of them lead, at
                        one point or another, to a landing page. As Scout’s digital marketing plan expanded, the Digital
                        Marketing Manager saw a need for a more unified experience for all interested parties.

                        I worked with her to create a set of templates that allowed us to deliver custom messaging depending on how visitors arrived
                        to the page. We included space for flexible imagery, value propositions, and input fields. This allowed
                        her to collect data on where traffic was coming from and analyze what messaging resulted in the highest
                        engagement rates.

                        users.

                        <p>Below you will see a collection of images featuring what was once an empty office. In November 2017,
                            I flew out to Chicago, met with Scout's President, and helped turn a blank slate into Scout's Chicago
                            home. The goal was to make the place a fun, creative, and collaborative environment that shows
                            pride in the Scout brand. The tricky part was that none of my co-workers one floor below had
                            the foggiest idea why I was in Chicago, or that they'd be moving in a couple of months. Needless
                            to say, this was a hard secret to keep.</p>

                        <p>I worked with Anna Badowski, the executive assistant, to plan color palettes, signage, and decals
                            that matched Scout’s style. When I flew back to Boston, I went to work creating all of the necessary
                            files and assets that we passed off to the amazing team at
                            <a href="https://www.cushingco.com/portfolio/scout-exchange/"
                                style="color: white" target="blank">Cushing</a> for production and installation. </p>

                        all of the assets at Scout and made the icon library cohesive and a reflection of Scout’s high-tech
                        roots. The sample below is a small batch, specifically focused on perks and benefits. Can you take
