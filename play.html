                            <p>PLAY is a platform to help parents balance their child’s digital activity with real-world play
                                time. As our society gets progressively more digital every day, exposing children to technology
                                at an early age can help prepare them for using tools that they will use for the rest of
                                their lives. In addition, the multitude of learning programs and educational resources available
                                to today’s children is astounding. But one thing is inevitable: tech is also a toy, and children
                                LOVE to play.
                            </p>

                            <p>Play time is extremely important for childhood development, and it teaches kids valuable lessons
                                like sportsmanship, healthy exercise habits, and social skills. Time engaging with the real
                                world does not lose its value in a digital age, and tablets and phones are not a good substitute
                                for face-to-face interactions.</p>

                            <p>I came up with the PLAY platform to answer the following question: “How can I make sure my child
                                is spending enough time playing in real life while still exposing them to technology?” </p>

                            <p>The slides below are an introduction to the PLAY platform and what it can do for parents. While
                                the product does not exist, I took the opportunity to mock up the branding, product images,
                                and general tone of the product. Still to come is a prototype of the mobile application.
                                Stay tuned for that at a later date!</p>
