                                    <p>PLAY is a platform to help parents balance their child’s digital activity with real-world play time. As our society gets progressively more digital every day, exposing children to technology at an early age can help prepare them for using tools that they will use for the rest of their lives. In addition, the multitude of learning programs and educational resources available to today’s children is astounding. But one thing is inevitable: tech is also a toy, and children LOVE to play.
                                    </p>
            
                                    <p>Play time is extremely important for childhood development, and it teaches kids valuable lessons like sportsmanship, healthy exercise habits, and social skills. Time engaging with the real world does not lose its value in a digital age, and tablets and phones are not a good substitute for face-to-face interactions.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I came up with the PLAY platform to answer the following question: “How can I make sure my child is spending enough time playing in real life while still exposing them to technology?” </p>
            
                                    <p>The slides below are an introduction to the PLAY platform and what it can do for parents. While the product does not exist, I took the opportunity to mock up the branding, product images, and general tone of the product. Still to come is a prototype of the mobile application. Stay tuned for that at a later date!</p>
