                        <h2>THE BASICS</h2>
                        <p>My name is Brad, and I really believe in design. Not just graphic design, or web design, or UI and
                            UX. I believe in design as a force. For me, there’s no better moment than when something comes
                            together conceptually, functionally, and beautifully. I want to help people make those moments
                            every day.</p>

                        <p>So, a bit about me. I’ll say up front that I am a bit of a graphics nerd. I like margins and glyphs
                            and colors; don’t even get me started on typographic hierarchy. But, (and yes, I started a sentence
                            with a conjunction but believe it or not <a href="https://bit.ly/2roLWof" target="blank">that’s okay</a>) I also love functionality. I don’t care
                            how lovely a flyer is if I can’t gleam information from it. I won’t use a gorgeous minimalist
                            website if I can’t follow the login process. </p>
                        <br>


                        <h2>MORE RECENTLY</h2>
                        <p>I love learning and getting better at what I do. Within the past year I have relocated across the
                            country. Rather than jump back into the same work I had been doing, I took some time off to improve
                            in areas where I felt I needed more exposure. </p>

                        <p>I wanted to learn more about digital design and UI and UX principles, so I took some online classes
                            and feel like it’s the kind I work I was meant to do. It combines what I love about graphic design
                            with the satisfaction of learning if what I made was useable. </p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>THE GIST</h2>
                        <p>The point of everything you just read is that I am ready to embark on my next cliché… I mean journey.
                            I want to use my new skills to make beautiful work. I want to design with functionality in mind
                            and will jump at the chance to make prototypes. If you are in the market for a designer who is
                            focused on getting results, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

                        <p>I could keep going, but all the guidelines on the web say not to bore your site visitors with walls
                            of text, so I’ll wrap it up with this: <strong>I am available, and I'm looking for more opportunities to
                                flex my mental muscles and help make great things. </strong></p>
