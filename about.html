                        <h2>THE BASICS</h2>
                        <p>My name is Brad, and I really believe in design. Not just graphic design, or web design, or UI and
                            UX. I believe in design as a force. For me, there’s no better moment than when something comes
                            together conceptually, functionally, and beautifully. I want to help people make those moments
                            every day.</p>

                        <p>So, a bit about me. I’ll say up front that I am a bit of a graphics nerd. I like margins and glyphs
                            and colors; don’t even get me started on typographic hierarchy. But, (and yes, I started a sentence
                            with a conjunction but believe it or not <a href="https://bit.ly/2roLWof" target="blank">that’s okay</a>) I also love functionality. I don’t care
                            how lovely a flyer is if I can’t glean information from it. I won’t use a gorgeous minimalist
                            website if I can’t follow the login process. </p>
                        <br>


                        <h2>MORE RECENTLY</h2>
                        <p>Currently, I am a UX designer at Conversion Fanatics. I have had the amazing opportunity to work on more than 40 websites designing experiences that help companies better engage with their users. I work with project managers and developers to identify business goals, user behavior and pain points. I design experiences that address these concerns and we split test them in order to determine if the change is successful.
                        </p>

                        <p>I have worked with companies of every size with goals ranging from ecommerce sales performance to affiliate marketing. Some of the better-known businesses I have worked with are Magnolia, BH Cosmetics, and Alen Air Purifiers. I’m always thrilled when we find a winner for our clients because I know it means we’ve understood their users better and we have improved their experience in an actionable way. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>THE GIST</h2>
                        <p>I care greatly about my work because it is my way of making an impact for anyone who uses something I helped build. I always design with functionality in mind and jump at the chance to make prototypes. If you want to connect with a designer who is focused on getting results and learning something with every project, I’d love to hear from you.
                        </p>
